This is a public dataset for white blood cell object detection
The dataset includes five subclasses of white blood cells: eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The types and positions of white blood cells in the images have been manually and accurately annotated using an annotation tool, and the annotation information files are stored in .txt, .xml, and .csv formats to meet the format requirements of different network model training for annotation files.

The "all_annos_folde" contains all the annotation files.

The "all_images_folder" folder contains all the original images of white blood cells.

The "train.txt", "test.txt", and "val.txt" files contain the names of images saved with the dataset division.

The "class.txt" file contains the annotation names for the categories of white blood cells.
